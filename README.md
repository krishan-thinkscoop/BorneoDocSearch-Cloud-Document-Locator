Welcome to `CloudDocFinder`, the ultimate solution for swift and
efficient document retrieval from the vast expanse of the cloud.

# Overview

Cloud storage is a blessing, offering massive storage spaces and easy
accessibility. However, with the accumulation of countless documents,
pinpointing a specific one becomes akin to finding a needle in a
haystack. CloudDocFinder aims to simplify this with its robust search
functionality, eliminating the need to manually sift through thousands
of files.

# Background

Over time, a plethora of documents gets stacked in our cloud storage.
Retrieving a particular file based on its content becomes an arduous
task. CloudDocFinder serves as the bridge to this gap, allowing users to
search documents with precision and ease.

# Problem Statement

The ubiquitous use of cloud storage has led to a common problem: finding
specific files based on their content or titles. This application stands
as a beacon, offering a streamlined solution to this widespread issue.

# Phased Approach

Breaking down the solution into manageable chunks ensures iterative
implementation. Each phase:

1.  Enhances the value provided in the preceding phase. Their sequential
    order inherently signifies their priority.

2.  Is deemed complete only when all its stipulated requirements are
    met.

3.  Is structured to offer end-to-end value. Even if only one phase is
    tackled, it should feel like a novel feature to the user.

## Phase 1: Document Scanning
